# Terminal
Roguelike game set in the future. You are a hacker trying to catch a payday,
and have heard rumor that data worth billions is in the private networks of the
Mitsuri Corp. After weeks of searching through the backroads of the global net
and the mess that is the undersprawl, you managed to find a trace of an
entrance into their networks; a backdoor that an irrate former employee had
left. Can you get to the data and escaped with your brain intact?
